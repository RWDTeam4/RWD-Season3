# RWD-Season3
Code Repo for the RWD Competition Robots

NOTES:
-Will likely be sharing this repo across two teams (Teams 3 and 4)
-Need to divvy out specific to team 4 and then general tasks needed for the common platform

TODO:
-Link repositories if we end up splitting up common, and team specific code
-Create a list of tasks needed to be programmed.
-Create a list of reference material for understanding/setting up an environment


Reference Material:
Raspberry Pi
